## LISA SMOLKIN

Live performance art event by me with brand new video, real-time interactivity via chat window with you, the participant.

A live internet portal to these things:

- In an instant Paradise turns to an active volcano scene turns to Hell. That’s what it is to be human. Experiencing life through sensation and emotion; every moment is an unending.

- Indoor playground sensory experiences help in getting in touch with ancestors. Do they even like me?

- A dream of walking on a floating staircase comes true

- The tropes that make you feel like not a person.

- Am I a lil bitch? Why do people treat me like this? I apologize all the time.

- How to have fun even though you might be processing a lot of feelings, events, and working at the same time (experiential not prescriptive)

## Bio

Lisa Smolkin is an artist living and working in Toronto. Her art practice comprises performance, video, and drawing, exploring themes of selfhood and feminism by incorporating elements from popular culture and healing traditions within humorous narrative structures. She engages audiences in an investigation of aspects of the ‘feminine’ that are generally undervalued and deemed ‘not-serious,’ from family/interpersonal dynamics to fashion. She was a frequent performer at Doored, a performance art/conceptual comedy show in Toronto put on by Life of a Craphead. She looks forward to her continued exploration into the matter of human developmental issues, feelings of invisibility, and the pain of relational disconnect in her work.
